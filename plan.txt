TO DO:
X new branch: dev2
X take navbar menu animation (dropdown) from "newer" version
X add variables for css
X temporarily disconnect components from app
- create components:
    X navbar
    X skill section (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, adobe creative cloud, microsoft office, etc.)
    X experience entry (maybe reuse for education too)
    - carousel item (use material-ui paper - input: an image, caption that displays when hovered)
